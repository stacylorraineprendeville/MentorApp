It is optional to fill out all the fields shown in the survey. In case you wish to delete your response, you will have the option to do so or skip a question you do not want to respond to. In case you want to delete all the information you provided, and if you have finished the survey, you also have the option to delete all your previous answers. \n\n 2.
